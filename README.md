# Wheel Rim Classification with Transfer Learning

## Introduction
This repository contains the actual training code (`rim classification w Torch.ipynb`) used to develop a model for classifying wheel rims with high accuracy. The model utilizes the power of PyTorch, along with transfer learning from VGG16 and advanced image processing techniques, to achieve impressive results on a dataset of images containing 16 different types of wheel rims.

Please note that this code was developed for Toyota and is not intended for commercial use or distribution. The purpose of this project is to showcase my image processing, augmentation, and modeling skills to potential employers.

## Model Performance
The model achieved a notable **100% ACCURACY** in classifying **9 different types of wheel rims**. This achievement was accomplished by employing cutting-edge image processing techniques to extract the wheel rims from the images and leveraging transfer learning from VGG16, implemented using PyTorch. The model demonstrates consistent performance, processing 4,000 wheel rims every day (equivalent to 12,000 a month) without any false negatives or false positives. This highlights the effectiveness of transfer learning and image processing in enhancing computer vision models.

## Usage
This repository contains the training code, serving as a reference for similar projects and showcasing the capabilities of PyTorch and advanced image processing techniques. The included notebook (`rim classification w Torch.ipynb`) provides insights into the methodologies employed. However, please note that this repository does not provide a step-by-step guide for developing a similar model.

Please note that this repository is not intended for use as a standalone program, as it was specifically tailored to address the unique requirements of the wheel rim classification task for Toyota Turkey.

## Acknowledgments
