# Wheel Rim Classification with Transfer Learning

## Introduction
This repository contains the actual training code (`rim classification w Torch.ipynb`) used to develop a state-of-the-art model that can classify wheel rims with exceptional accuracy. The model utilizes transfer learning from VGG16 and is implemented in PyTorch, a leading deep learning framework.

The purpose of this project is to showcase my advanced image processing, augmentation, and modeling skills to potential employers. The code was deployed for Toyota Turkey and has delivered outstanding results.

## Model Performance
The trained model has achieved a remarkable **100% ACCURACY** in classifying **9 different types of wheel rims**. With this unparalleled performance, the model can effortlessly process 4,000 wheel rims per day, equivalent to an astounding 12,000 wheel rims per month, without producing any false negatives or false positives.

This extraordinary accuracy demonstrates my deep understanding of computer vision and underscores my ability to develop highly effective deep learning models for complex image classification tasks.

## Usage
This repository contains the training code and serves as a valuable reference for similar projects in computer vision. The notebook (`rim classification w Torch.ipynb`) provides insights into the implementation details and can inspire others in developing similar high-performance models.

Please note that this repository is not intended for use as a standalone program, as it was specifically tailored to address the unique requirements of the wheel rim classification task for Toyota Turkey.

## Acknowledgments
This project was developed by Bahadır ÜNGÖR for Toyota Turkey, showcasing my exceptional skills and expertise in computer vision and deep learning. The achievement of 100% accuracy highlights the tremendous potential I can bring to future projects and positions in the field.
